        <p class="about-paragraph">The basic idea behind <kbd>_busy</kbd> is to put a to-do list in a convenient place that makes tasks hard to forget about.</p>

        <p class="about-paragraph">The upper-limit on items on a to-do list is enforced to reduce the stress typically associated with to-do lists.</p>
        <hr>
        <p id="aboutMainStatement">The idea isn't to have a huge, insurmountable to-do list that will just let you procrastinate further, but rather have an organizational tool that allows you to break down larger tasks into digestable fragments; hence the dichotomy between a 'Daily List' and a 'Weekly List'.</p>
